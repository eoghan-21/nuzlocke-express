Full change log to be added.

Tasks I'm working on next:
Make branching evos work.
Make it so encounter types that are empty for a route do not shop up as options.
If you own a TM and pokemon can learn it, add it to its available moves.
Gate different encounter types by unlocks (surf = gym badge, radar = item, honey = item, headbutt = tm, fishing rod grade = items)
Implement notifications when new things become available for pokemon (evolutions, moves)
Add starter pokemon selection as first screen upon starting game
Incorporate dupes clause
Make it so you can only use 1 of certain item types.
Make it so gift pokemon can be selected, not rolled randomly.
Add opponent preview for Renegade platinum early game.

And more!
